/// - **Junk run**: a run of four or more identical punctuation/symbol characters inside the

/// - **Seam misspelling**: in the mid-word case (caret inside a word, completion starts with word
///   characters), the joined word formed across the seam must be known to the spell checker.
/// - **Leading-word misspelling**: when the completion starts a new word, the first generated word
///   is checked only when the caller can both identify it as a typo and offer a correction. This is
///   deliberately narrower than dictionary membership so names, jargon, and model vocabulary still
///   pass through when the native checker has no actionable fix.

/// short words (under four letters), words with digits, and CJK text (no space-delimited word
/// boundaries, and the dictionaries do not cover it).
